# Hermes Legion

A Hermes Agent plugin for managing organizational hierarchies — fleets, teams, agents, projects, and reporting lines across your Hermes agent ecosystem.

## Features

### Fleet Management
- Create and manage **fleets** (companies/groups) containing teams of Hermes agents
- Assign agents to teams with roles and reporting lines
- Visual org-chart hierarchy with flowchart rendering

### Fleet Leadership
- Assign a **Leader / CEO** at the top of each fleet's hierarchy
- Assign a **Manager** as second-in-command (reports to CEO, all agents report to Manager)
- Add a **Summariser** and **Reflection Coach** that operate across all fleets

### Project Management
- Create projects and assign them to fleets or individual teams
- Link projects to **workspace folders** and **GitHub repositories**
- Create **sub-projects** with their own task lists
- Attach **documents** to projects (links, files, design specs, meeting notes)
- Kanban board integration for task tracking

### Dashboard
- Fleet overview with agent counts, team stats, and blocked task indicators
- Per-fleet hierarchy flowcharts embedded in the Org Chart view
- Scheduled Tasks view: every fleet agent in hierarchy order with their scheduled tasks listed underneath
- Unassigned agent profile detection
